## new things I've learned

- How CSS grid can remove some of the "heavy-lifting" of responsiveness via features like fractional units or functions like repeat() and minmax()
- Further understood the differences between `auto-fill` and `auto-fit`
- How to make CSS background images more accessible using the `role` and `aria-label` attributes, while acknowledging [W3C's documentation on background image accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2016/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20160105/F39).
