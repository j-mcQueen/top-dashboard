# dashboard

An in-browser literature community dashboard designed to test my design skills and understanding of CSS grid. This project was developed as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript course - check out my [live version](https://silverwish.github.io/top-dashboard/).

## new things I've learned

- How CSS grid can remove some of the "heavy-lifting" of responsiveness via features like fractional units or functions like repeat() and minmax()
- Further understood the differences between `auto-fill` and `auto-fit`
- How to make CSS background images more accessible using the `role` and `aria-label` attributes, while acknowledging [W3C's documentation on background image accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/2016/WD-WCAG20-TECHS-20160105/F39).

## biggest challenges

- Curating a compelling colour scheme and design
- Ensuring images are sized consistently and positioned appropriately, mainly via the grid dimensions
- Ensuring the grid containers and items inside the main body of content behave in an acceptable manner when the window is resized

## technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- [Haikei](https://app.haikei.app/) for user icon colour gradient

## known bugs/ areas for improvement

- Lacks robust responsiveness
- Sidebar links are not active

## notes

- Sidebar icon svgs were sourced from [SVGBox](https://svgbox.net/)
- Main content icon svgs were sourced from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- All background images were sourced from Google Images matching the "Free to Share and Use" licence search condition
- Book descriptions were edited from the synopses provided by Goodreads or Wikipedia
